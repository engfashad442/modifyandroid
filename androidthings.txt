The two classes below can be used to saved data in to our device memory
SharedPreferences --> for reading
SharedPreferences.Editor --> for writing to the memory of our device
Intent is one of greatest android API aka class 
Intent has many functionality as listed below:
1. To launch our camera
2. To send SMS
3. To make call in our application
4. To wire Activities together
5. To pass data from one Activities to another

SharedPreferences sharedpreferenace 
  SharedPreferences.Editor meditor;
                meditor =  getSharedPreferences("my app", PRIVATE_MODE)

				Abstraction is a process in which the tedious part of work is being hidden
				for example motor users dont know the process in which the brake of motor or engine is being made by enigineer
				their own is just to press pedal and it will stop. Another of real life scenario of abstraction is this word.
				no human being knows how God created this world we just found our self in it.
				However, in java abstraction can be achieved by using abstract class and interface
				Encapulation: this is the process of protect class functions and properties from other class to have access to them
				Other classes can only have access to these properties through setter and getter method 
				An abstract function or method is a method with definition but no implementation. 
				however, an interface is a collection of abstract methods
				i.e an interface is like a container that holds multiple abstract methods i.e method without implementation but only definition
				
                An interface with no methods in it is referred to as a tagging interface

				Serilization in java
				converting object to sequence of bytes which contain inforamtion of the data type and inforamtion about the object it self .
				a scenario that can be compared with serilization is when packet of inforamtionis being sent over network , the inforantion will be broken to 
				pieces for easy flow of inforamtion over network which can be assembled together to form the entire inforamtion.
				deserilization is the process of converting bytes of object back to original object.
				the real life of scenario of serilization and deserilization is when a motor is being broken in to diffrent parts and ship to a country and 
				is being assembled together in another country.
				note: serilization and ]definition are platform independent.
				The two major classes used in serilization are:
				1.ObjectInputStream 
				2.ObjectOutputStream

dialogue is a box that displayed to user for confirmation
Dialogue box is more complicated than just ordinary layout 
dailogue box is a class that has its own layouts and widgets  
in android there are two ways to create dialogue:
1.Dialogue class
2.Fragment class. 
the professional way of making dialogue in android is by using  the second option because the first method does not follow activity
lifecyle which can lead to app crash. 
steps to create dialogue in android 
. create class in the same package name with the mainactivity class
2.extend DailogueFragment clsss.
3.override the method called onCreateDailogue
4.AlertDialogue.Builder builder = new AlertDialogue(getActivity());
Note: calling two or more methods on the same object on the same line is knnow as method chaining
5. builder object of the class created is the major object used in creating dialogue
6. buildr.setMessage() is used to show message to the user 
7.builder.setPositiveButton() is used to add button to the dialogue box created.
note: dilaogue box is similar to alert in javascript or confirm() function in javascript
the method in number seven takes to arguments 
1. The test that will be shown to user on the button
2. anonymous class, new DialogueInterface.onClickListener(){
public onClick(DialogueInterface dialogue , int id){}

}
8. Return the dilaogue by calling the create() method on the builder object
